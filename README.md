# Standalone version setup

## Requirements:
 - Ubuntu 16.04 or newer (for server)
 - Docker 1.13.0 or newer (for container running machine)

**IMPORTANT**
**This operation requires sensitive data as real accounts name and passwords. That data is not sent anywhere else except your server and not gathered by ThinkMobiles company.**
**All credentials can be changed on server after project will be deployed.`**

## Application configuration
1. Clone project with command
```sh
git clone https://github.com/thinkmobiles/eqa eqa
```
2. Go to the `eqa` folder
```sh
cd eqa
```
3. Open file `standalone/ansible_provision/hosts` (which is [Ansibleâ€™s inventory file](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html)) and set values.

 - **SERVER_IP** - your server ip address.
 - **APP_NAME** - this will serve as application folder name, application setings folder name, part of database name, database user name (`eqa` recomended).
 - **APP_DOMAIN** - your app domain for Phusion Passenger and Nginx server configuration (can be set as IP address).
 - **deploy_user** - system user for deploy which will be created on server (`value shouldn't be changed`).
 - **deploy_folder** - should be `/home/deploy/www/` (`value shouldn't be changed`).
 - **DEPLOY_USER_PASSWORD_PLAIN** - deploy user password in plain text.
 - **DEPLOY_USER_PASSWORD_SHA_512** - password for deploy_user, encrypted in md5.
The simplest way to ge it is to run in console next command
`mkpasswd --method=sha-512 DEPLOY_USER_PASSWORD_PLAIN`.
 - **GIT_HTTPS_USERNAME** - GitHub account name for cloning project
 - **GIT_HTTPS_PASSWORD** - GitHub account password for cloning project
 - **ROOT_PASSWORD** - server root account password
 - **SECRET_KEY_BASE** - 128 symbols sequence which serves for security porposes..
The simplest way to ge it is to run in console next command
`openssl rand -hex 64`
 - **SECRET_EMAIL** - email which will be used to send messages from application.
 - **SECRET_EMAIL_PASSWORD** - email password in plain text format
 - **ACTION_MAILER_ADDRESS** - email server domain
 - **ACTION_MAILER_SDOMAIN** - email server subdomain
 - **DEVISE_EMAIL** - email which will be in "From" field when you will restore your account (may be the same as SECRET_EMAIL).
 - **DEVISE_SECRET_KEY** - anothe 128 symbols sequence which serves for security porposes.
The simplest way to ge it is to run in console next command
`openssl rand -hex 64`
 - **ssl_sertificate_present** - must be true or false.
 - **CERTIFICATE_FILE_ABSOLUTE_PATH** - absolute path to certificate file.
 - **KEY_FILE_ABSOLUTE_PATH** - absolute path to key file.

## Server setup:
 - in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` set `PasswordAuthentication yes`
 - restart **sshd** service with command
```sh
service sshd restart
```
 - root password on server and ROOT_PASSWORD in `standalone/ansible_provision/hosts` file must be equal
 - put **SSL** certificate files and set **CERTIFICATE_FILE_ABSOLUTE_PATH** **KEY_FILE_ABSOLUTE_PATH** in `hosts` file.

Provision run
```sh
docker build -t eqa .
docker run -it eqa
```

After all scripts finish opening your app in browser (visit ip address or application URL).

To remove unnecessary Docker data from machine use commands:
```sh
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm $(docker images -q)
```
